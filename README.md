### [NeuralNetworks](https://github.com/kevinmsong/NeuralNetworks)

- AdaGradOptimizer contains code implementing a custom AdaGrad neural network gradient descent optimizer from scratch.

- LogisticRegression contains code for training a neural-network-based logistic regression classification model from scratch in PyTorch.

- MNIST contains code for implementing, training, and error-scoring a series of feedforward neural networks, in Keras, for recognizing handwritten MNIST digits (with a best macro average test F1 score of 97%).

- TranscriptionFactorBinding contains code for implementing and training a neural network to predict the presence/absence of transcription factor binding sites in DNA fragments.

### [MachineLearning](https://github.com/kevinmsong/MachineLearning)

- RealEstatePrediction contains an encoded XGBoost regression model (trained with randomized grid search and 5-fold cross-validation) and an IPython notebook that implements code for predicting 2021 estimated full cash values from 2016-2020 housing data in the Tuscon, Arizona real estate market (test root mean squared error of $8,568 for a dataset of 101,661 homes).

- AnthemMiniProject contains a data science project for predicting the chance of insurance policy renewals with XGBoost.

- CostEffectiveMaintenance contains code that exhibits data wrangling/feature engineering skills, and trains an XGBoost classifier to determine whether corporate truck maintenances from a real-life dataset (hosted on a MySQL server) are either cost-effective or cost-ineffective.

- KNearestNeighbors contains code that implements, from scratch, a two-dimensional k-nearest neighbors regression algorithm.

- LinearRegression contains code that implements a linear regression, from scratch, without using scikit-learn.

- RetailDemandForecasting contains work on feature engineering and demand forecasting of weekly companywide sales with a 2011-2012 Walmart retail dataset.

- SongAnalytica contains code that prototypes using a statistical model (XGBoost) to determine whether U.S. presidents' re-election chances are correlated with approval rating features. Inspired by the following [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating).

### [CodingProblems](https://github.com/kevinmsong/CodingProblems)

- Alignment uses [Needleman-Wunsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) and [Smith-Waterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm) algorithms to perform alignment of genetic sequences.

- PerfectSquare uses Newton's method to evaluate whether an integer is a perfect square, inspired by [this paper](https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/18.335/newton-sqrt.pdf).
